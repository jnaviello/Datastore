                A group of entities that can communicate even though they are not directly connected.
                There has to be at least three entities and there has to be a way that entities that are not directly
                connected can still communicate.

                A server is a computer that interacts with a request we make to the computer. For example, whenever we type in "http://www.google.com", 
				we are sending a request to Google's servers to return a website.

                   Get parameters are included in the URL.  Get requests are used for fetching documents.  Get parameters have a 
				   max URL length. Get parameters are generally ok to cache.  Get parameters should not change the server
                </p>

                <p>
                    Post parameters are included in the body.  Post parameters are used for updating data or actually making changes.
					Post parameters have no max length.  Post parameters are almost never cached.  post requests are usually destructive in nature.

                    Web applications are vulnerable if you don't practice input validation.
                    Validation is one of the simplest ways to check if a page is built in accordance with web
                    standards, and provides on of the most reliable ways to ensure your page is safe and reliable.

                    We need to verify what the user enters and confirm if the data is bad.  Using something like
                    a drop-down is not enough to ensure that the user is not passing bad data to our form.

                    Templates refer to a library used to build complicated strings (html).  Jinja2 is a template
                    library that was used to make this web page.  Avoiding repetition is necessary when programming.
                    You want to avoid having to rewrite the same code
                    multiple times.

                <p>
                    The syntax for substituting a variable in Jinja is a double curly brace.
                    Substitution is basically just printing the variable.  This is a handy way to substitute a
                    string while maintaining cleaner code.

                    This is a great way to avoid repetition and makes your code more organized and easier to read.
                    This lets you define a base template which you can later plug new HTML into. This is useful when,
                    for example, you want to have a consistent header and footer across your app.  Remember better
                    organized code is more readable,easier to fix, easier to share, and harder to break.
